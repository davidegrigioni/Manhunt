# Manhunt   
This aims to be the best available Manhunt plugin on the market.<br>
Me and a friend of mine saw that many of the Manhunt plugins available on Spigot and here on GitHub are not really the best and only offer few to no features.<br>
We saw the only plugin available that is "good" is not for free.<br>
As I want to learn how to do Minigames in the best way possible here is my solution. hope you like it!

FEATURES:<br>
  GUIs = Thanks to InventoryFramework I don't have to work much on GUIs, they should be fast 100% customizable.<br>
  WorldCreator integrated = You shouldn't download any other plugin to generate the Manhunt world!<br>
  Settings = You can only make a few settings for now but in the future we're going to add more!<br>
  Random Events = Choose between Delphin and Hardcore Random Events! In the future we're going to add alot more =).<br>
  Configurable Scoreboards = All scoreboard are fully configurable, the only problem is for now Scoreboards doesn't support MiniMessage!<br>
  MiniMessage Support = We aimed to support MiniMessage as you can do more things that the normal ChatColor library.<br>
  Your feature? Please open a GitHub Issue or contact me on Spigot! If I'll see much interaction with this plugin I'll create a Discord server!
