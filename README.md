<h1>Manhunt</h1>

Welcome to Manhunt, the ultimate minigame plugin for your server! Designed to provide the best possible Manhunt experience, this plugin is packed with features that set it apart from the competition.

With our easy-to-use GUIs powered by InventoryFramework, you'll be able to create custom interfaces that are fully customizable and lightning fast. And with WorldCreator integrated into the plugin, you won't need any additional software to generate the perfect Manhunt world.

Our plugin comes with a variety of settings that allow you to customize your gameplay experience, including the ability to choose between Delphin and Hardcore Random Events. And with fully configurable scoreboards, you can keep track of all the important details without missing a beat.

But that's not all – we also support MiniMessage, which means you can take your text formatting to the next level with advanced features that go beyond traditional ChatColor libraries.

In addition to our core features, we use a variety of powerful libraries to ensure the best possible experience for our users. These include LiteCommands for easy command management, bStats for detailed usage tracking, PlaceholderAPI for versatile placeholder functionality, BoostedYAML for smooth configuration management, and SternalBoard for advanced scoreboard functionality.

But we're always looking for ways to improve our plugin, and we welcome your feedback and suggestions. Whether you have a feature request or just want to say hi, please feel free to contact us on Spigot or open a GitHub Issue. And who knows – if we see enough engagement, we might even create a Discord server for our dedicated Manhunt community!
